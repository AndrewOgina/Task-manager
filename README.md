# Time Blocker

A modern, efficient task management app built with Django, designed to help users optimize their daily schedules by breaking tasks into time blocks. Unlike traditional to-do lists, this app allows users to visualize their day in structured time blocks, increasing productivity and focus.

## Features
- [ ] **Time Block Organization**: Break your day into focused time blocks, each dedicated to a specific task or activity.
- [ ] **Task Nesting**: Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks within designated time blocks for enhanced organization and productivity.

## How It Works
The Time Block Task Manager App helps you:
1. **Modularize Your Day**: Break your tasks into focused, time-specific blocks, instead of a lengthy to-do list. 
2. **Visualize Your Day**: See exactly what you need to do, and when to do it, helping you stay organized and productive.
3. **Increase Focus**: By dedicating specific time blocks to specific tasks, you can reduce distractions and increase focus on the task at hand.
